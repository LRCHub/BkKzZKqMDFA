[00:25.17] Strangers in a dark room, laughing at jokes they didn't quite hear
[00:33.06] Frosted window panes and cheap champagne a face appears
[00:41.96] And anything could happen in these cathedrals we roam
[00:50.01] Where shadow people dance and trade their glance and walk home alone
[01:24.01] 
[01:32.04] She's staring out the window of the Roosevelt Hotel
[01:40.02] Watching midtown empty out and I kiss her farewell
[01:48.17] They say we come from nothing and to nothing we'll return
[01:56.91] And in between is gravity and bridges left to burn
