I'm in control of the night-time
Niggas is hurting like Twilight
Hiding from the daylight
I can't have nobody see me
Upside down next to my brothers
God licking holy water
The cross is something altogether I stay away from
One bite, you'll be gone forever
Look me in my eyes, I look normal
Deep inside I've got a problem
Often I won't acknowledge
People just think I'm awkward
Sleep up in the coffin
A lot of smoke but no reefer
A lot of people take their life for granted
I'm cursed and can't stand it
Niggas canned and played out
Your blood come in handy
I've got a taste for human flesh
Sandy
She thinks I'm cute
And normal
She gives me her soul because I'm abnormal
She feels that I'm better than whoever
We have a problem
She got me thinking by 12 o'clock
She the perfect sacrifice for dessert
Feel weird my hands are numb
Fangs coming out my teeth
I hide a Moses in the back of my Naga Cerebro
Looking like Professor X when he met the leader
I'm sure I had a purpose
The influential person
They put me down in my brain
I followed because it was a mirror of pain
Monkey see, monkey do
You look like me, I look like you
I was clouded by thinking
My conscience tore apart
Until I lost the greatest heart
I stopped fighting vampires
Like it? They loved it
Another soul for destruction
Don't let the vampires get you
Don't let the vampires get you
Don't let the vampires get you
Don't let the vampires get you
Don't let the vampires get you
Don't let the vampires get you
