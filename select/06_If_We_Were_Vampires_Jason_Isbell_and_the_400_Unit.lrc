[00:19.20] It's not the long flowing dress that you're in
[00:24.53] Or the light coming off of your skin
[00:29.25] The fragile heart you protected for so long
[00:34.60] Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong
[00:57.10] 
[00:39.02] It's not your hands, searching slow in the dark
[00:44.12] Or your nails leaving love's watermark
[00:49.05] It's not the way you talk me off the roof
[00:54.42] Your questions like directions to the truth
[01:15.92] 
[00:59.56] It's knowing that this can't go on forever
[01:04.50] Likely, one of us will have to spend some days alone
[01:09.69] Maybe we'll get 40 years together
[01:13.15] But one day, I'll be gone or one day, you'll be gone
[01:39.15] 
[01:18.98] If we were vampires and death was a joke
[01:23.79] We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
[01:29.35] And laugh at all the lovers and their plans
[01:34.24] I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
[01:55.24] 
[01:38.94] Maybe time running out is a gift
[01:43.74] I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
[01:49.24] And give you every second I can find
[01:54.18] And hope it isn't me who's left behind
[02:13.18] 
[01:59.34] It's knowing that this can't go on forever
[02:04.41] Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
[02:09.57] Maybe we'll get 40 years together
[02:13.02] One day, I'll be gone, one day you'll be gone
[02:35.52] 
[02:59.42] It's knowing that this can't go on forever
[03:04.34] Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
[03:09.36] Maybe we'll get 40 years together
[03:12.87] One day I'll be gone, one day you'll be gone
